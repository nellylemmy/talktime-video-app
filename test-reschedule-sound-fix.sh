echo "🎵 Testing Reschedule Notification Sound Fix"
echo "=========================================="
echo ""

echo "📋 Instructions to test the reschedule sound:"
echo "1. Open browser to: http://localhost/volunteer/dashboard/upcoming.html"
echo "2. Login as a volunteer (if not already logged in)"
echo "3. Find a meeting and click 'Reschedule'"
echo "4. Select a new time and confirm"
echo "5. You should now hear the reschedule sound 🔊"
echo ""

echo "🔊 The fix includes:"
echo "✅ Manual sound triggering after successful reschedule API call"
echo "✅ Multiple fallback methods for sound triggering"
echo "✅ Increased redirect delay (3 seconds) to allow Socket.IO events"
echo "✅ Direct Socket.IO event listener on schedule page"
echo "✅ Sound system properly loaded via volunteer nav-loader.js"
echo ""

echo "🐛 Debug tips:"
echo "- Open browser console (F12) to see sound trigger logs"
echo "- Look for messages like '🔊 Triggering reschedule sound manually...'"
echo "- Check for Socket.IO event logs: '🔔 Schedule page received meeting-rescheduled event'"
echo "- Verify sound system is loaded: look for '🔊 Notification sound system ready'"
echo ""

echo "📁 Files modified:"
echo "- /frontends/volunteer/public/dashboard/schedule.html (manual sound triggering)"
echo "- Sound system already loaded via /frontends/volunteer/public/partials/nav-loader.js"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Testing alternative methods:"
echo "If reschedule still doesn't work, test individual sound components:"
echo "1. Go to: http://localhost/tests/test-notification-sound-integration.html"
echo "2. Click 'Meeting Rescheduled' button - should hear sound"
echo "3. Click 'Simulate Real Notification' - should hear sound"
echo "4. If tests work but real reschedule doesn't, check browser console for errors"
echo ""

echo "✅ Fix applied! Test by rescheduling a meeting now."
