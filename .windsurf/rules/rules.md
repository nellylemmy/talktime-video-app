# strictly and I repeat strictly, we are using talktimedb_dev as our database so these are the files we need to use strictly so make sure frontend is conecting to backend using backend schema as priority and not the other way round.

## use

/Users/ADEA/Documents/development/adea_chat_app/vidaa/talktime/nginx/development.conf for the nginx.
